## About

Project from The Odin Project Intermediate HTML and CSS course. Project page found [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-intermediate-html-and-css-admin-dashboard).

## Step 1: Set up and planning

1. [X] Create github repo and clone it
2. [X] Create html and css files with some dummy content to verify they are connected and working as intended.
3. [X] Download full res copy of the [project design file](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/43cc6ab69fdfbef40d431a65677d2144668930ac/intermediate_html_css/grid/project_admin_dashboard/imgs/dashboard-project.png) as a reference.

## Step 2: Layout

1. [X] Start by writing out the HTML elements for the sidebar, header and main-content containers.
2. [X] In your CSS file, apply Grid properties until you have this basic layout built.

## Step 3: Nesting

1. [ ] Taking it one section at a time, begin nesting child elements under the parent elements in the HTML. Remember that you can keep making grid containers within grid containers.
    1. [X] Create nested elements for header
    2. [ ] Create nested elements for sidebar
    3. [ ] Create nested elements for main content
2. [ ] In the sidebar, use more grids to lay out the navigation and branding sections.
3. [ ] In the header, use more grids to lay out the search bar, user info and buttons.
4. [ ] For the main-content, use more grids to lay out the projects, announcements and trending items.
5. [ ] Fill out some dummy content and placeholder images so you can position all of your grid items.
